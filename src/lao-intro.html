      <h2>Learning Lao /</h2>

    </div>

    <p>Visiting Laos next year I wanted to be a little bit prepared and learn
    as much of the lanugage as possible. While probably not entirely necessary
    since we'll mostly have a local guide and English and body language are
    usually enough in most countries, I always think it's nice to be able to
    communicate with the locals in their own language, and who knows, it might
    yield some better prices while bargaining at the market (ຕະຫຼາດ).</p>

    <p>While there is some (but not all too much) information out there in a
    variety of media, I've decided to put together the bits and pieces that
    are important to me while learning Lao in this web app.</p>

    <h3>Script</h3>

    <p>Following the book "Lao Basics" (which has the advantage of coming with a
    huge amount of mp3 files spoken by a native speaker), I've started by
    learning the different symbols of Lao script and how to pronounce them.</p>

    <p>Lao consists of 26 consonants (or 27 including one, that is no longer in
    use) and 6 (or 7) digraphs. Additionally there are 21 vowel symbols that can
    be combined around the consonants to  create almost 50 different vowels.</p>

    <p>I will add a separate section for this once I find the time, but until
    then the references below should cover all the information you need.</p>

    <h3>Tones</h3>

    <p>Lao is a tonal language, meaning that in addition to the pronounciation,
    also the (change in) pitch influences meaning, so that e.g. a 'maa' spoken
    at a high pitch can be a completely different word than a 'maa' spoken at a
    low or rising pitch.</p>

    <p>Knowing how to write the words allows you to determine which tone has to
    be used, at least in theory. Which tone is actually used for a specfic
    consonant/vowel-combination depends on what region of Laos you are visiting
    and even for the more common dialects there are different opinions.</p>

    <p>The most common dialect taught in different media is the dialect of the
    capital of Laos, Vientiane. I went with the easiest interpretation of that
    dialect using 5 different tones, as shown in the <a href="/chart">tone
    chart</a>.</p>

    <p>The <a href="/romanization">romanization tool</a> uses the tone chart
    to show the pronounciation including tones for any Lao text entered or
    pasted.</p>

    <h3>Grammar</h3>

    <p>With no conjugation or declination of any kind grammar in Lao is rather
    simple. The most important aspect that can often change the meaning of
    sentences is the word order.</p>

    <p>A separate section about this coming soon...</p>

    <h3>Vocabulary</h3>

    <p>Definitely the most important part of speaking any language is knowning
    enough words to say what you want to say.</p>

    <p>I've started assembling my own set of Anki flash cards for this, which
    I'm learning with every day now. I might add some important phrases &amp;
    words to this page eventually.</p>
